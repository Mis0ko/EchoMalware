## Overview

This project aimed to get used to some basics methods of obfuscation (function, aliasing, anti-debug/IDA, etc).<br>
You can find 2 versions of the code, one that summarize the main functionnalities and the other one with a lot of
junk code aim to lost the group of student who had to analyse it.

## Obfuscation

There were a lot of code that was added (up to 1000lines), with a lot of fake variables and same principle
of obfuscation were implemented for the fake variables / functions.<br/>
Plus, a lot of functions calls were made and repeated with a copy and past along the program so
the groupe who analyse would be oviously lost with all these functions called.
In addition, a lot of overlapping was added everywhere in the code so a majority of important code (and
junk code) was hidden with this technic.

## Technical Documentation

You can find in this repository the slides of the presentation of the malware in details *(malware JLM)*,<br/>
the analysis we made on the K101 team malware and some note-taking of the analysis of the K101 malware we made<br/>
to share the analysis between our team members.
