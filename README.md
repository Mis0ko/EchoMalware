This project aimed to get used to some basics methods of obfuscation (function, aliasing, anti-debug/IDA, etc).
You can find 2 versions of the code, one that summarize the main functionnalities and the other one with a lot of
junk code aim to lost the group of student who had to analyse it.

There were a lot of code that was added (up to 1000lines), with a lot of fake variables and same principle
of obfuscation were implemented for the fake variables / functions.
Plus, a lot of functions calls were made and repeated with a copy and past along the program so
the groupe who analyse would be oviously lost with all these functions called.
In addition, a lot of overlapping was added everywhere in the code so a majority of important code (and
junk code) was hidden with this technic.

Finally you can also find in this repository the slides of the presentation of the malware in details (malware JLM),
the analysis we made on the K101 team malware and some note-taking of the analysis of the K101 malware we made
to share the analysis between our team members.
